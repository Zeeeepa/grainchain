## ðŸ”§ Configuration Status

âœ… **E2B_API_KEY**: Successfully configured and validated
âœ… **DAYTONA_API_KEY**: Successfully configured and validated
âœ… **Local Provider**: Operational (no API key required)

## ðŸ“ˆ Performance Analysis

1. **Local Provider**: Fastest execution (0.029s total) - ideal for development and testing
2. **E2B Provider**: Good performance (0.715s total) - reliable remote execution
3. **Daytona Provider**: Solid performance (0.798s total) - consistent remote execution

## âœ… Success Criteria Met

- [x] Both providers can be successfully initialized
- [x] Benchmark tests pass for both providers (100% success rate)
- [x] Performance metrics validated (all providers operational)
- [x] Documentation updated with setup steps

## ðŸš€ Next Steps

All providers are now ready for comprehensive benchmarking and production use. The grain-chain system can leverage all three providers based on specific use case requirements:

- **Local**: For fast development and testing
- **E2B**: For reliable remote sandbox execution
- **Daytona**: For scalable remote development environments
